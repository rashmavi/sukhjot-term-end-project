<p>1.corona virus is<strong> a very deadly virus</strong>.</p>
<p>2.Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause<strong> illness ranging from the common cold</strong></p>to more severe diseases. 
<p>3.some symptoms are<strong> cough, cold,loss of taste and smell etc.</strong>.</p>
<p>4.The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. 
    Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include loss of
     taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, red eyes,
      diarrhoea, or a skin rash.<strong> cough, cold,loss of taste and smell etc.</strong>.</p>

      <p>he most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE,
           although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more,
            implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species.[72]
             The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about
              2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line 
              at 2800 BCE, and the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE. Bats and birds, 
              as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus 
              gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirus 
              â€“ and birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses). 
              The large number and global range of bat and avian species that host viruses have
               enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.[73]<strong>
